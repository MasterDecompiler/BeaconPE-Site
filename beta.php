                    <p>A Beta Build is a PocketBukkit build that has been known to be semi-stable.  These build WILL include but is not limited to things like bugs, or unimplemented things.  These builds may also have things like memory leaks.  Memory Leaks are things that may cause your machines CPU usage to spike from time to time.  Beta Builds are not recommended for large servers but they do not limit any features.</p>
